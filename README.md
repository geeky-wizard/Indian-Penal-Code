# Indian-Penal-Code

This is a project based on the Imply-Logic system used in the laguage Prolog. Predicates and logic is used to decide (programatically) whether a person is a criminal or not. Predicates, which denote an act which can be considered as a crime, are taken as input from the user by giving them a TRUE value.

The rules from the IPC (indian penal code) were taken (without any alteration) from a few chapters for deciding a crime.

The variables to be used for input (crime/person) are given in the file Variables.txt.
